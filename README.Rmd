The goal of TargomoR is to provide an interface to the Targomo API for users of `leaflet` in R.

**This package is being developed with the permission of Targomo, but is NOT AN OFFICIAL PRODUCT. For more information about Targomo, please see their [website](https://www.targomo.com/developers/).**

**Please also be aware of the Targomo [Terms and Conditions](https://account.targomo.com/legal/terms).**

Please see below for information on [installing](#installation) the package, setting up your [environment](#set-up-environment) correctly, and [using](#get-travel-time-data) the package.


## Installation {#install}

TargomoR is not yet on CRAN. To install this development version from GitHub please use:
```{r install, eval=FALSE}
remotes::install_github("cwthom/TargomoR")
library(TargomoR)
```

## Set Up Environment {#env}

The functions in TargomoR all rely on having a Targomo API Key. To get yours, please [sign up with Targomo](https://www.targomo.com/products/pricing/?package=free#api). 

You'll also need to know what region of the world to use. For example if you're looking for travel-time information in Germany, your region is "westcentraleurope". [Find your region](https://targomo.com/developers/availability/). In the examples on this page the region is "britishisles".

You can pass these variables to each function manually if you like, but to avoid this, the functions will default to use the `TARGOMO_API_KEY` and `TARGOMO_REGION` environment variables respectively.

To take advantage of this, you can set these variables in an .Renviron file. Use the following snippet to write the variables to the file.

```{r env, eval=FALSE}
setTargomoVariables(api_key = "<YOUR KEY>", region = "<YOUR REGION>",
                    global = FALSE)

# global = TRUE  will write to .Renviron at Sys.getenv("HOME")
# global = FALSE will write to .Renviron at getwd()
```

Restart R for these variables to take effect.

## Get Travel Time Data {#use}

You're now ready to use Targomo to get travel-time and routing data. There are three services currently supported:

* [Isochrone Polygons](https://targomo.com/developers/services/polygon/)
* [Routing](https://targomo.com/developers/services/routing/)
* [Reachability](https://targomo.com/developers/services/reachability/)

The reachability service is referred to here as the time service.

For each service there are 2 core functions:

* `getTargomo{service}` - returns an `sf` object containing the requested data.
* `addTargomo{service}` - adds the polygons/routes/times to a `leaflet` map.

The `add*` functions are provided as a convenience - feel free to create your own drawing functions to put the data onto a map!

## Inputs {#input}

Each service requires basic inputs (alongside the API key and region):

* **sources** - these are the starting points for your travel calculations. For the polygon service, they're the points from which isochrones are calculated.
* **targets** - not used for polygons. For the route and time services, these are the destination points.
* **options** - these are travel time options to pass to the API, created in a call to `targomoOptions()`. This is designed to feel familiar to users of `leaflet` with functions like `labelOptions` and `popupOptions`.

#### Sources & Targets

Sources and targets are defined either by `data.frame`-like objects (including classes exported from the `sf` package) or by vectors of longitude and latitude coordinates. Again the syntax should feel familiar to `leaflet` users. 

For example, we could define two data frames as so:
```{r source-target}
source_data <- data.frame(id = "A", lat = 51.52, lng = -0.19)
target_data <- data.frame(id = c("X", "Y", "Z"),
                          lat = c(51.50, 51.515, 51.51), 
                          lng = c(-0.18, -0.185, -0.17))
```

#### Other Arguments

Additional optional arguments are:

* `verbose` - FALSE by default. Should the call to the API be printed? Helpful for debugging.
* `progress` - FALSE by default. Should the call mark progress with a progress bar? Helpful for when connections are slow or the call is large (many sources/targets).

## Outputs {#output}

The return value of the `getTargomo{service}` functions varies by service. In all cases, spatial data is returned in CRS 4326.

### Polygons {#output-poly}

For the isochrone polygon service, `getTargomoPolygons` returns a Simple Feature Collection of 2 fields. The fields are:

* time - the time in seconds of each isochrone
* area - the area in square metres of the isochrone

Each feature is a POLYGON (or MULTIPOLYGON). There is one feature per time specified in the `travelTimes` argument of `targomoOptions` - see [options](#options) below.

```{r get-polygon}
polygons <- getTargomoPolygons(source_data = source_data,
                               source_lat = ~lat, source_lng = ~lng,
                               options = targomoOptions(travelType = "bike"))
polygons
```

Using the `addTargomoPolygons` function we can add them directly to a leaflet map:

### Routes {#output-route}

For the routing service, `getTargomoRoutes` returns a named nested list. The names are the travel modes given in the `travelType` option (specifying multiple modes will make multiple calls to the API).

Within each travel mode is a list of the returned routes - one for each source/target combination where a route has been found. Each route is a data.frame, containing the source and target IDs, and a `features` data.frame of a simple feature collection (class 'sf'). This contains: 

* points - the source and target points of the route, as POINT objects.
* walk, bike, car, transit - the routes by each mode of transport (where requested) as LINESTRING objects.
* transfers - points where public transport changes (e.g. change bus) as POINT objects.

Each SFC also contains fields giving the start and end names of the LINESTRINGs, the length of time the section takes and the distance in metres. 

For example, for three routes by bike, the output will look like:

```{r get-route}
routes <- getTargomoRoutes(source_data = source_data, target_data = target_data,
                           source_lat = ~lat, source_lng = ~lng,
                           target_lat = ~lat, target_lng = ~lng,
                           source_id = ~id, target_id = ~id,
                           options = targomoOptions(travelType = "bike"))

str(routes, max.level = 3, give.attr = FALSE)
```

The `features` object for the first route will look like:

```{r get-route-inner}
routes$bike[[1]]$features
```

Using `addTargomoRoutes` we can draw these routes nicely on the map. For example:

![Using the Targomo Route Service](man/figures/route-example.png)

### Times {#output-time}

For the time service, `getTargomoTimes` returns a Simple Feature Collection of 4 fields. Each feature is a POINT (corresponding to the target point), and the fields are:

* sourceId, targetId - given IDs for the points, or inferred numeric IDs if none supplied
* travelType - the travel mode (can supply multiple as with routes)
* travelTime - the time taken in seconds to get from the source to the target

```{r get-times}
times <- getTargomoTimes(source_data = source_data, target_data = target_data,
                         source_lat = ~lat, source_lng = ~lng,
                         target_lat = ~lat, target_lng = ~lng,
                         source_id = ~id, target_id = ~id,
                         options = targomoOptions(travelType = "bike"))
times
```

We can add time data directly to the map with `addTargomoTimes`:

## Options {#options}

There are 2 different types of options - core options to pass to the API, and drawing options to change how the result set is mapped (only used in the `add*` functions).

### API Options {#options-api}

To change the options passed to the API, you use the `targomoOptions` function within a `getTargomo{service}` call. Options are documented in the manual pages (use `?targomoOptions`).

### Drawing Options {#options-draw}

Each service has a drawing options function to customise how the features appear on the map. These should be used with the `drawOptions` argument to `addTargomo{service}`:

* Polygon - `polygonDrawOptions()`
* Route - `routeDrawOptions()`
* Time - `timeDrawOptions()`

These are also all documented in the manual pages (e.g. `?routeDrawOptions`).
